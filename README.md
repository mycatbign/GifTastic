Background - The GIFTastic applications displays 10 gifs for a selected animal. Clicking on the gif will cause                     the gif to animate and subsequent clicking will turn off the animation. Players can also add their own animal and click it to see animated gifs for their choices. This page is developed with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery as well as API calls to the Giphy.com site.
